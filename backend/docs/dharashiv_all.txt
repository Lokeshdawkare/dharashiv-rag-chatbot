eMutation – National Land Records modernization Program (NLRMP)
Entire Mutation work flow is now Computerized under this project. The information from the Registration office  is captured and transferred to Mutation Cell at Tehsil office where Digitally Signed Notice’s regarding Mutation entries are generated and send back to the originating SRO office. The SRO office serves the Notices and sends them back to Tehsil Office, Village Accountant along with the Registration details.
The Mutation process is initiated instantly as soon as Registration takes place. The mutation entry is certified by the Circle officer on completion of notice period and the ROR is updated. This has relieved the common man for waiting for the Notice to be served to him by Talathi, Going to Village for applying Mutation entry and getting his ROR updated. All types of Registered and Non Registered documents are covered under this project.

नळदुर्ग फोर्ट - नळदुर्ग
नळदुर्ग किल्ला – ऐतिहासिक पार्श्वभूमी :
उस्मानाबाद पासून ४६ कि.मी. अंतरावर असलेले नळदुर्ग किल्ल्यातील पाणी महाल प्रेक्षणीय व प्रसिद्ध आहे. हा प्रंचड किल्ला अडीच कि.मी.घेराचा असून अजूनही सुस्थितीत आहे. या किल्ल्याजवळून वाहणा-या बोरी नदीचे पाणी अडवून त्याचा उपयोग दुर्ग राक्षणासाठी केलेला फक्त येथेच आढळतो. तीन – चारशे वर्षापूर्वी देखील लष्करी शास्त्र किती पुढारलेले होते. याचा हा सबळ पुरावाच आहे. पावसाळ्यात या पाणी महालावरून पडणा-या पाहण्याचे विहंगमदृश्य पाहण्यासाठी दरवर्षी पर्यटक येतात.

Dharashiv Caves - Osmanabad

Historic, Religious
Dharashiv Caves – Historical Background :
The dharashiv caves are situated 8 Kms away from Osmanabad city in Balaghat Mountains. The caves were taken note of by Archaeological Department and mentioned in the book “Archaeological survey of India” by James Verges. There are total 7 caves in the Balaghat Mountain lane. The first cave is without any statue with small open space .The second cave consists of a statue with Artistic work on right side of statue. The art work is of gandharva era. The fourth cave is with open space without any statue inside. The statue in the sixth cave is damaged while the seventh cave has no statue. That this is an ancient place is shown by the caves excavated in the hill at a distance of about eight miles.
These caves were originally Buddhist, but were later converted into monuments of the Jain religion and fresh caves were also excavated nearby. Of this we shall speak later. There are some more Buddhist caves excavated in the hills, about 8 miles from Dharashiva. The earlier of them are referred by Burgess to the middle of the 7th century A. D. Cave No. II is modeled on the plan of the Vakataka caves at Ajanta. It has a central hall measuring 80 feet by 80 feet, with 14 cells for the residence of the Bhiksus and garbhagraha with a colossal image of the Buddha in Pamasana. From the hoods of a serpent spread over its head, it is supposed by some to be the image of the Jaina Tirthankara Parshwanath, but the figures of deer with a dharmacakra between them on the pedestal indicate that it is that of Gautama Buddha. Another cave (No. III) has a hall of 59’ by 59’, closely resembling Cave No. I. Later some Jain caves (No. V and VI) were excavated on the same hill. They are described in the Prakrt work Karakandacariu as excavated by the king Karakanda, who came to know about the earlier caves from the prince Siva of Terapura (Tagara).
The Karakandacariu is a work of the 11th century A. D. so these later caves were probably excavated in the 9th or 10th century A. D. during the age of Rastrakutas. As per the historical survey of caves they were built in 5th century B.C. There is severe differences between historical researchers & archaeological intelligence regarding religion i.e. whether the caves belongs to Buddha or Jain. There is also strong differences regarding the era of when the caves where built. Recently in 1996 with help of World Bank few parts of cave have been repaired.

Paranda Fort
Direction
Category
Historic, Religious
In 1599, Mughals defeated Nizam Shahi of Ahmednagar. Though Emperor Akbar appointed his officers to look after the kingdom of the Deccan, the Nizam Shah’s officers refused to receive orders from them. They had lost their independence. They declared Murtaza, the son of Shah Ali king and made Paranda Fort, about 75 miles south east of Ahmednagar capital. The site passed several times between them and the Adil Shahis and remained with him for two to three years and was captured by the Adil Shah in 1630. In 1657 it was again captured by the Moghuls and eventually came into the hands of the Nizams of Hyderabad

LAND RECORDS
eMutation – National Land Records modernization Program (NLRMP)
Entire Mutation work flow is now Computerized under this project. The information from the Registration office  is captured and transferred to Mutation Cell at Tehsil office where Digitally Signed Notice’s regarding Mutation entries are generated and send back to the originating SRO office. The SRO office serves the Notices and sends them back to Tehsil Office, Village Accountant along with the Registration details.
The Mutation process is initiated instantly as soon as Registration takes place. The mutation entry is certified by the Circle officer on completion of notice period and the ROR is updated. This has relieved the common man for waiting for the Notice to be served to him by Talathi, Going to Village for applying Mutation entry and getting his ROR updated. All types of Registered and Non Registered documents are covered under this project.

आय-रॅड प्रकल्प
आय-रॅड प्रकल्प बद्दल:-
एकात्मिक रस्ता अपघात डेटाबेस (आयआरएडी) प्रकल्प हा रस्ते वाहतूक आणि महामार्ग मंत्रालय (एमओआरटीएच), भारत सरकारचा एक उपक्रम आहे आणि देशातील रस्ते सुरक्षा सुधारण्याच्या उद्देशाने जागतिक बँकेद्वारे निधी दिला जातो. प्रकल्पाचा मुख्य उद्देश देशाच्या प्रत्येक भागातून अपघात डेटाबेस समृद्ध करण्यासाठी एकात्मिक रस्ता अपघात डेटाबेस (iRAD) विकसित करणे आहे. डेटा विश्लेषणाच्या तंत्राच्या अंमलबजावणीद्वारे देशभरात संकलित रस्ते अपघातांच्या आकडेवारीचे विश्लेषण करून हा प्रकल्प विविध प्रकारच्या अंतर्दृष्टी निर्माण करेल. प्रस्तावित यंत्रणा सुलभतेने समजून घेण्यासाठी आणि त्यानुसार नवीन धोरणे व कार्यनीती तयार करण्यासाठी अ‍ॅपेक्स प्राधिकरणाद्वारे अंदाज व निर्णय घेण्याकरिता मॉनिटरिंग आणि रिपोर्टिंग डॅशबोर्ड आणि Analyनालिटिक्स डॅशबोर्डद्वारे विश्लेषण आउटपुटचे प्रतिनिधित्व करेल. या प्रकल्पाचा परिणाम म्हणजे रस्ता सुरक्षा वाढवणे म्हणजेच भारतातील ‘सर्वांसाठी सुरक्षित रस्ता’.
हे कसे कार्य करते:-
आयआरएडी मोबाईल अॅप्लिकेशन पोलिस कर्मचाऱ्यांना रस्ते अपघाताविषयी तपशील, फोटो आणि व्हिडीओसह प्रविष्ट करण्यास सक्षम करेल, त्यानंतर घटनेसाठी एक अद्वितीय आयडी तयार केला जाईल. त्यानंतर सार्वजनिक बांधकाम विभाग किंवा स्थानिक संस्था कडून अभियंत्यास त्याच्या मोबाइल डिव्हाइसवर अलर्ट प्राप्त होईल. त्यानंतर तो किंवा ती अपघाताच्या जागेवर जाईल, तिचे परीक्षण करेल आणि रस्त्याच्या डिझाइनसारख्या आवश्यक गोष्टी फीड करेल. अशा प्रकारे संकलित केलेल्या डेटाचे आयआयटी-एम मधील संघाद्वारे विश्लेषण केले जाईल, जे नंतर रस्ता डिझाइनमध्ये सुधारात्मक उपाय करणे आवश्यक आहे का ते सुचवेल.

iRAD Project
About iRad Project:-
The Integrated Road Accident Database (iRAD) Project is an initiative of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), Government of India and is funded by World Bank, with objective to improve road safety in the country. The main objective of the project is development of Integrated Road Accident Database (iRAD), to enrich the accident databases from every parts of the country. The project would generate various types of insights by analyzing the collected road accident data across the country through implementation of data analytics technique. The proposed system would represent the analysis output through Monitoring & Reporting Dashboard & Analytics Dashboard for easy understanding and accordingly forecasting & Decision Making by Apex Authorities for formulation of new policies & strategies. The outcome of the project would be enhanced road safety i.e. ‘Safe Road for All’ in India.
How it Works:-
The IRAD mobile application will enable police personnel to enter details about a road accident, along with photos and videos, following which a unique ID will be created for the incident. Subsequently, an engineer from the Public Works Department or the local body will receive an alert on his mobile device. He or she will then visit the accident site, examine it, and feed the required details, such as the road design. Data thus collected will be analysed by a team at IIT-M, which will then suggest if corrective measures in road design need to be taken.
